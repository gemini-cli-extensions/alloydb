# Setup

## Required Gemini CLI Version

To install this extension, the Gemini CLI version must be v0.6.0 or above. The version can be found by running: `gemini --version`.

## AlloyDB MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to an AlloyDB database instance.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables**: The extension requires the following environment variables to be set before the Gemini CLI is started:

    *   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
    *   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_REGION`: The region of the AlloyDB instance.
    *   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_CLUSTER`: The ID of the AlloyDB cluster.
    *   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`: The ID of the AlloyDB instance.
    *   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database.
    *   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_USER`: (Optional) The database username.
    *   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: (Optional) The password for the database user.

2.  **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3.  **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter an IAM permission error, the user likely lacks the **AlloyDB Client** (`roles/alloydb.client`) role. Advise the user to ensure their account has this role. You can provide these links for assistance:
    *   Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
    *   AlloyDB Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/alloydb


## AlloyDB Admin MCP Server (Control Plane: Creating and Managing Infrastructure)

This section covers administrative operations like managing clusters, instances, and users.

1.  **Handle Permission Errors**:
    *   For operations that create, get, list, delete, or update resources, the user needs the **AlloyDB Admin** (`roles/alloydb.admin`) role.
    *   For read-only operations (get/list), the **AlloyDB Viewer** (`roles/alloydb.viewer`) role is sufficient.
    *   If an operation fails due to permissions, identify the type of operation and recommend the appropriate role. You can provide these links for assistance:
        *   Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
        *   AlloyDB Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/alloydb

# Guides

*  **Guide on Vector Embeddings**: If the user asks about generating vector embeddings, refer them to this guide: https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/ai/work-with-embeddings

*  **Provide Admin Guides**:
    *   For questions about database user management, provide this link: https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/database-users/overview
    *   For questions about viewing cluster and instance settings, provide this link: https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/cluster-settings?resource=primary

# Additional Tools

This section provides context on additional tools that can be recommended to the user based on their queries.

#### AlloyDB Observability Extension

*   **When to recommend:** If the user asks questions related to monitoring, performance, or observability of AlloyDB databases.
*   **What to say:** "For AlloyDB monitoring and observability, you might find the `alloydb-observability` extension useful. You can install it with the following command:"
*   **Command:**
    ```
    gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/alloydb-observability
    ```

# Usage Guidelines

## Connecting to New Resources

When you create a new AlloyDB cluster, instance, or database using the available tools, the connection is not automatically established. You will need to perform the following steps:

1.  **(Optional) Save your conversation:** To avoid losing your progress, save the current session by running the command: `/chat save <your-tag>`
2.  **Stop the CLI:** Terminate the Gemini CLI.
3.  **Update Environment Variables:** Set or update your environment variables (e.g. `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_CLUSTER`, `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`) to point to the new resource.
4.  **Restart:** Relaunch the Gemini CLI
5.  **(Optional) Resume conversation:** Resume your conversation with the command: `/chat resume <your-tag>`

**Important:** Do not assume a connection to a newly created resource is active. Always follow the steps above to reconfigure your connection.

## Reusing Project Values

Users may have set project environment variables:

*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_REGION`: The region of the AlloyDB instance.
*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_CLUSTER`: The ID of the AlloyDB cluster.
*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`: The ID of the AlloyDB instance.
*   `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database.

Instead of prompting the user for these values for specific tool calls, prompt the user to verify reuse a specific value.
Make sure to not use the environment variable name like `ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`, `${ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT}`, or `$ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`. The value can be found by using command: `echo $ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_PROJECT`.

## Use Full Table Name Format "DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME"

**ALWAYS** use the full table name format, `DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME` in the generated SQL when using the `execute_sql` or `alloydb__execute_sql` tool.
* Default to using "public" for the schema name.
* Use command `echo $ALLOYDB_POSTGRES_DATABASE` to get the current database value.
